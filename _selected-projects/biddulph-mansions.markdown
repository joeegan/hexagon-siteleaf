This project involved the extension, remodelling and complete refurbishment of a top-floor mansion block apartment on Elgin Avenue in Maida Vale.

Working with Bocci Ghodke Architects, Hexagon helped bring a highly coordinated and detailed interior to fruition. Site constraints made the structural works involved in extending the roof and creating double-height spaces challenging. Freeholder restrictions and the Grade II listing complicated matters further however, the end result was a uniquely spectacular duplex apartment in a beautiful West London street.
